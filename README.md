Simseketal_SegmentationwoClock_Manuscript

This code incorporates segmentation clock as an inhibitor into FGF signaling pathway simulation. No clock, no diffusion and pulsatilesutreatment cases can be simulated by changing relevant parameters. Clock is defined according to its experimentally determined period change from posterior to anterior PSM, with a simplified sine function. Amplitude of the clock is constant along the PSM.

Createfigure.m converts mesh kymographs into publication style 2-D plots.

detrendcode.m is detrending the data from live imaging, and extracting phases of oscillations.
